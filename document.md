### 1. Overview of the MEAN Stack

**What is the MEAN Stack?**  
- **M**ongoDB: NoSQL database that stores data in flexible JSON-like documents.  
- **E**xpress.js: Lightweight, flexible Node.js framework for building web servers and APIs.  
- **A**ngular: Front-end framework developed by Google for building dynamic, single-page applications (SPAs).  
- **N**ode.js: JavaScript runtime environment that allows running JS on the server side.

**Key Benefits of MEAN:**  
- All JavaScript Stack: Front-end, back-end, and database querying in JavaScript.  
- JSON data flow: Smooth data exchange between layers.  
- Scalability & Rapid Development: Ideal for quick prototypes and scalable applications.

### 2. Node.js

**Architecture & Event Loop:**  
- Node.js uses a single-threaded, event-driven, non-blocking I/O model.  
- Understand the event loop, callback queue, and how asynchronous operations prevent blocking.

**Modules & NPM:**  
- Distinguish between CommonJS `require` and ES Modules `import`.  
- Understanding package management with NPM or Yarn, Semantic Versioning, and package-lock.json.

**Asynchronous Programming:**  
- Callbacks, Promises, async/await pattern.  
- Error-first callbacks and how to handle asynchronous errors.  
- Using utilities like `util.promisify` and working with streams.

**Error Handling & Debugging:**  
- Using try/catch for synchronous errors and `.catch()` for promise errors.  
- Node’s built-in debugger, logging frameworks (Winston, Morgan), and environment-specific configs.

---

### 3. Express.js

**Core Concepts & Setup:**  
- Creating an Express server and starting a Node process.  
- Understanding the `app.listen()` method and request-response cycle.

**Routing & Middleware:**  
- Difference between application-level and router-level middleware.  
- Built-in middleware (e.g., `express.json()`, `express.urlencoded()`) and custom middleware for logging, authentication, etc.  
- Order of middleware execution and `next()` function usage.

**Templating Engines vs. APIs:**  
- Using templating engines (like EJS, Handlebars, Pug) if needed.  
- Typically in MEAN, Express serves as a REST API returning JSON to the Angular client.

**Request Handling & RESTful Services:**  
- Defining routes with `app.get()`, `app.post()`, etc.  
- Building RESTful endpoints, handling query parameters, URL parameters, and request bodies.

---

### 4. MongoDB & Mongoose

**MongoDB Basics & Core Operations:**  
- Document-oriented structure (BSON), collections, and the flexible schema approach.  
- Basic CRUD operations: `insertOne`, `find`, `updateOne`, `deleteOne`.

**Data Modeling with Mongoose:**  
- Defining Schemas and Models.  
- Field types, validation, and using Mongoose middleware (pre/post hooks).  
- Relationship modeling: Referencing documents vs. embedding documents.

**CRUD Operations & Aggregation:**  
- Using Mongoose methods: `find()`, `findOne()`, `findById()`, `save()`, `updateOne()`, `deleteOne()`.  
- Aggregation pipelines for advanced queries (grouping, sorting, projecting).

**Indexes & Performance Optimization:**  
- Creating indexes to speed up read operations.  
- Understanding trade-offs: write speed vs. read speed.  
- Using MongoDB Compass or the CLI for analysis.

---

### 5. Angular

**Core Concepts & Architecture:**  
- Angular uses TypeScript, component-based architecture, and MVVM pattern.  
- Understand the root module (`AppModule`), bootstrap process, and component tree.

**Components, Modules, & Services:**  
- Creating components using Angular CLI.  
- Difference between declarations, imports, providers, and exports in NgModules.  
- Creating and injecting services for shared data and logic via Angular’s DI system.

**Data Binding & Directives:**  
- One-way binding: `{{}}` interpolation.  
- Two-way binding with `[(ngModel)]`.  
- Structural directives (`*ngIf`, `*ngFor`) and attribute directives.

**Routing & Navigation:**  
- Configuring routes in `AppRoutingModule`.  
- Route parameters and route guards (e.g. `CanActivate`).  
- Lazy loading modules to optimize performance.

**HttpClient & REST API Integration:**  
- Using `HttpClientModule` to make GET, POST, PUT, DELETE requests.  
- Handling observables, subscribing to HTTP calls, and using RxJS operators (e.g. `map`, `catchError`).

**Observables & RxJS Basics:**  
- Difference between Observables and Promises.  
- Understanding `Subject`, `BehaviorSubject`, and common RxJS operators.

**Forms (Template-Driven & Reactive):**  
- Template-driven forms: Using `ngModel`.  
- Reactive forms: Using `FormBuilder`, `FormGroup`, `FormControl`.  
- Validation (built-in and custom validators).

**State Management:**  
- Simple service-based state vs. NgRx for complex state management.  
- NgRx store, actions, reducers, effects, selectors.

**Angular CLI & Project Structure:**  
- Generating components, services, modules using `ng generate`.  
- Best practices for folder organization and code structure.

### 6. Full-Stack Considerations

**Integrating the Stack End-to-End:**  
- Typical flow: Angular (front-end) → Express (API) → MongoDB (database).  
- Data retrieval and update patterns.

**RESTful API Design & JSON Structures:**  
- Designing clear, consistent endpoints.  
- Using proper HTTP methods: GET for read, POST for create, PUT/PATCH for update, DELETE for remove.  
- Returning meaningful HTTP status codes and error messages.

**Authentication & Authorization (JWT, OAuth):**  
- Implementing JWT authentication flow: sign tokens on server-side, store tokens client-side (localStorage or memory).  
- Secure routes in Express with middleware that checks tokens.  
- Secure Angular routes with route guards.

**Security & Best Practices:**  
- Enabling CORS for cross-domain requests.  
- Using Helmet middleware for security headers.  
- Sanitizing user input to prevent XSS/Injection attacks.
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse.

**Testing (Jasmine, Karma, Mocha, Chai, Supertest):**  
- Unit testing Angular components with Jasmine and Karma.  
- API testing in Node with Mocha, Chai, Supertest.  
- Importance of test coverage and CI/CD integration.

**Performance Optimizations & Caching:**  
- Using GZIP compression, CDN, and caching headers.  
- Angular optimization: Lazy loading, AOT compilation, and optimizing change detection strategies.  
- MongoDB indexing and Node.js clustering or PM2 for scaling.

**Deployment & DevOps Considerations:**  
- Containerization with Docker.  
- CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or CircleCI.  
- Hosting: AWS, Azure, GCP, or Heroku.  
- Environment variables and configuration management.

### 1. Node.js Core Architecture

**Event Loop & Libuv:**  
- Node.js uses Libuv, a C library, to handle the event loop and asynchronous I/O.
- The event loop has multiple phases (timers, I/O callbacks, idle, poll, check, close) and cycles through these phases on each tick.

**Microtasks & NextTick Queue:**  
- Promises and `process.nextTick()` callbacks run on microtask queues, which get processed after the current operation but before the next event loop tick.
- Understanding microtask queues is crucial to prevent starvation and ensure predictable async flows.

---

### 2. Asynchronous Patterns & Concurrency

**Promises & async/await:**  
- async/await provides cleaner syntax over callbacks and Promises.
- Always wrap async functions in try/catch for proper error handling.

**Streams & Backpressure:**
- Streams handle data in chunks. This prevents memory overload compared to buffering entire payloads.
- Backpressure is managed using `readable.pause()`, `readable.resume()`, or ensuring `write()` returns false before pushing more data.

**Worker Threads:**
```js
const { Worker } = require('worker_threads');
const worker = new Worker('./workerTask.js', { workerData: { complexCalculation: true } });
worker.on('message', result => console.log('Result:', result));
worker.on('error', err => console.error(err));
```
- Useful for CPU-bound tasks without blocking the main event loop.

**Cluster Module:**
- Spawn multiple Node.js processes (workers) that share the same port.
- Improves throughput on multi-core servers.
- Use a reverse proxy or a load balancer (NGINX) in production for even load distribution.

---

### 3. Performance & Profiling

**Tools:**
- **Clinic.js** (clinic doctor, flame, bubbleprof): Understand event loop delays and CPU usage.
- **Chrome DevTools Inspector:** `node --inspect` and `chrome://inspect` to debug and profile CPU/Memory.
- **0x:** Flamegraph visualization for CPU usage.

**Identifying Memory Leaks:**
- Use `heapdump` to generate and analyze heap snapshots.
- Compare snapshots before and after stress tests to identify leak patterns.

---

### 4. Error Handling & Reliability

**Uncaught Exceptions & Rejections:**
- `process.on('uncaughtException', ...)` and `process.on('unhandledRejection', ...)` should be used only to log and gracefully shut down.
- Implement robust error handling in application code.  
- Prefer returning consistent error objects with `message`, `code`, and `details`.

**Graceful Shutdown:**
```js
process.on('SIGTERM', () => {
  server.close(() => {
    console.log('Closed out remaining connections');
    process.exit(0);
  });
});
```
- Close open connections, flush logs, and release resources before exiting.

**Resilience Patterns:**
- Implement retries with exponential backoff for transient errors.
- Use a circuit breaker to prevent cascading failures when a dependency is down.

---

### 5. Security & Best Practices

- Keep dependencies up-to-date and run `npm audit` regularly.
- Use environment variables for secrets, never commit credentials.
- Validate and sanitize all user input to prevent injection attacks.
- Consider `Helmet` and `rate-limits` in the Express layer.
- Limit event loop blocking operations to prevent DoS attacks.

---

### 6. Scalability & Deployment

**Horizontal Scaling:**
- Launch multiple Node processes using `cluster` or run multiple Docker containers behind a load balancer.
- Use a message queue (Redis, RabbitMQ) for asynchronous tasks and scaling background jobs.

**Process Managers:**
- PM2 can restart crashed processes, manage logs, and enable zero-downtime reloads.

**Containerization & Orchestration:**
- Dockerize your Node.js app.
- Use Kubernetes for rolling updates, health checks, and autoscaling.

---

### 7. Testing Strategies

**Unit Tests:**
- Use Jest or Mocha with Chai assertions.
- Mock external services and databases to isolate logic.

**Integration & E2E Tests:**
- Use Supertest to test Express routes without starting a full server.
- Use Cypress or Playwright for end-to-end tests with Angular front-end.

**CI/CD Integration:**
- Run tests on every commit with GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or Jenkins.
- Enforce coverage thresholds and code quality checks.

---

### 8. Module System & Project Structure

**ES Modules vs. CommonJS:**
- Node.js now supports ES Modules natively (`"type": "module"` in package.json).
- Consider Babel or SWC if you need backward compatibility.

**Project Organization:**
```
project/
 ├─ src/
 │   ├─ app.js
 │   ├─ routes/
 │   ├─ services/
 │   ├─ helpers/
 │   └─ config/
 ├─ tests/
 ├─ package.json
 └─ .env
```

**Monorepos:**
- Use Nx or Lerna to manage multiple packages and shared code in one repository.

---

### 9. Build Tools & Bundling

**Transpilation:**
- Use Babel or SWC to target older Node versions or for advanced language features.
- Tree-shaking is less critical on the server but can reduce startup time.

**Precompiled Binaries:**
- Tools like `pkg` can bundle your Node.js app into a single binary for faster startup and easier distribution.

---

### 10. Logging, Monitoring, & Observability

**Structured Logging:**
```js
const pino = require('pino');
const logger = pino();
logger.info({ userId: 123 }, 'User logged in');
```

**Tracing & Metrics:**
- OpenTelemetry provides standardized tracing APIs.
- Emit custom metrics (latency, request rates) to Prometheus, visualize in Grafana.

**APM:**
- Integrate APM agents from New Relic, Datadog, or Elastic APM for real-time performance insights.

---

### 11. Integrating Node.js with MEAN Stack

**Data Fetching from MongoDB:**
- Use async functions to query MongoDB and return JSON responses to Angular clients via Express.
- Implement caching layers with Redis for frequent queries.

**Authentication:**
- Validate JWT tokens in Express middleware before allowing access to protected routes.
- Refresh tokens securely and handle token expiration gracefully.

**Pagination & Streaming:**
- Paginate large MongoDB query results.
- Use streams to send large data sets to Angular clients without blocking.

---

### 12. Advanced Code Examples & Patterns

**Worker Thread Example:**
```js
// workerTask.js
const { parentPort, workerData } = require('worker_threads');
// Some CPU-intensive computation
const result = heavyComputation(workerData);
parentPort.postMessage(result);
```

**Graceful Shutdown Hook:**
```js
function shutdown() {
  server.close(() => {
    console.log('HTTP server closed');
    mongoose.connection.close(false, () => {
      console.log('MongoDB connection closed');
      process.exit(0);
    });
  });
}

process.on('SIGINT', shutdown);
process.on('SIGTERM', shutdown);
```

**Custom Transform Stream:**
```js
const { Transform } = require('stream');
const upperCaseTransform = new Transform({
  transform(chunk, encoding, callback) {
    callback(null, chunk.toString().toUpperCase());
  }
});
```

**Circuit Breaker with Opossum:**
```js
const CircuitBreaker = require('opossum');
const options = { timeout: 3000, errorThresholdPercentage: 50, resetTimeout: 30000 };
const breaker = new CircuitBreaker(apiCall, options);

breaker.on('open', () => console.log('Circuit opened - failing fast'));
breaker.on('halfOpen', () => console.log('Circuit half-open, testing service'));
breaker.on('close', () => console.log('Circuit closed - service restored'));
```
